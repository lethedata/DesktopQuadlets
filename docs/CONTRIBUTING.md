# Contributing Guidelines

## Documentation:

- Lack of documentation is a **bug**!
- If the service or target is complex, make sure to document how things are
connected and function.

## Formatting:

- Line length should be under **80 chars** with a hard limit of 120 chars.
- If limit is not met, add "line breaks needed" to commit message.
If committing directly, open a formatting issue referencing the file as well.

## Commit Message:

- Must follow [conventional commits](
https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0).
- Header must be less than **72 chars**.
